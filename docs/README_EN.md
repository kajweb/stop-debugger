A `Chrome Extension` and `system proxy`  for **disable** the **debugger** function in `Chrome DevTools`。

一个**禁止**`Chrome DevTools`中执行**debugger**的拓展和`系统代理`。

## Instructions for use

This program is divided into two parts: `chrome browser extension` and `Node system agent`.

- Chrome browser extension

  The `chrome browser extension` is used to cover the feature functions of the browser. The source code of the browser extension is in the directory of `chrome-extension`. The extension needs to be installed in the browser before use. After the extension is installed, the extension needs to be turned on to take effect.

  [Detailed description of the offline installation method of Chrome plug-in](https://huajiakeji.com/utilities/2019-01/1791.html)

- Node system agent

  The `Node system agent` is used to process the `debugger` appearing in files such as javascript`, `html`, and `json`, use specific regular expressions to match the `debugger`, and annotate the corresponding code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kajweb/stop-debugger.git
cd stop-debugger/proxy-serve 
cd proxy-serve
npm i
npm run en
```

> The https link needs to install the certificate to the `Trusted Root Certification Authority`, otherwise it may not be able to process HTTPS requests.
>
> For `win7` and `win10` systems, the system program will be called to import the certificate into the system when the Node client is running.
>
> Other systems currently do not support automatic certificate import.



## Test Address

We provide a relatively rich test page to test the debugger. You can open the `Chrome DevTools` and click the corresponding item to view the running result.

## Directory Structure


| Directory name | Function |
| :---: | :--- |
| **depoly** | github page deployment page, used to provide developers to test the debugger operation |
| **proxy-serve** | Node proxy server code. Debugger for blocking plaintext |
| **chrome-extension** | Source code of chrome extension. Used to shield specific functions that can execute the `debugger` method, |
| | Such as `Function()`, ʻeval()`, `Function.prototype.constructor` and other methods |
| **cert** | Certificate directory. The code used to generate the CA certificate and sign the client certificate. |
| | In fact, the generated CA certificate has been copied from `/cert/ca` to `/proxy-serve/src/cert`. |
| | Subsequent client issuing certificates are taken over by `/proxy-serve/src/cert/index.js`, developers do not need to pay much attention to this directory. |
| **dev** | Program test development directory, most of which are meaningless codes. |
| | It is only used for various experimental tests during the development process, and developers do not need to pay too much attention to this directory. |
| **docs** | System documentation directory, covering documents in various languages, |


## Support Plan

Can be in [deploy](./deploy/), or open [online test page](http://test.iwwee.com/debugger/extensionSet.html)

- - [x] debugger without semicolon


> This type of code is processed by `proxy-serve`
```js
let a = 1, b = 2;
debugger
let c = a+b;
```

- - [x] debugger with semicolon

>This type of code uses `proxy-serve` for processing

```js
let a = 1, b = 2;
debugger;
let c = a+b;
```

- - [x] (multi-statement) debugger with statement after it

>This type of code uses `proxy-serve` for processing


```js
let a = 1, b = 2;
debugger;let c = a+b;
```

- - [x] (multiple statements) debugger with statements before and after

>This type of code uses `proxy-serve` for processing


```js
let a = 1,b = 2;debugger;let c = a+b;
```

- - [x] (multi-statement) debugger with statement in front

>This type of code uses `proxy-serve` for processing


```js
let a = 1, b = 2; debugger
let c = a+b;
```

- - [x] Debugger generated by Function

> This type of code is processed using `chrome-extension`


```js
let fn = new Function("debu"+"gger");
fn()
```

- - [x] Multi-parameter debugger generated by Function

> This type of code is processed using `chrome-extension`

```js
let fn = new Function("x","debugger");
fn()
```

- - [x] Prevent simple detection

> This type of code is processed using `chrome-extension`

```js
let a = ";debugger;"
if( a!==";debug" + "ger;" ){
console.log("User Behavior Abnormal")
}
debugger
```

- - [x] Use eval to execute debugger

> This type of code is processed using `chrome-extension`

```js
eval("debugger");
```

- - [x] Use Function to execute debugger

> This type of code is processed using `chrome-extension`

```js
// https://blog.csdn.net/zhsworld/article/details/104660742
Function.prototype.constructor("debugger")()
```


- - [ ] Use Function to execute debugger (obfuscated)

>This type of code will be processed with `chrome-extension`

```js
// http://www.sc.10086.cn/service/login.html

let _0x2764ed = {
	wcluU: "debu",
	tvBGO: "gger",
	tOyvN: "action",	
	vyxZy(a,b){return a+b}
}

function xhs__0x4f79(e){
	switch(e){
		case '0x1e3':
			return "constructor";
			break;
		case '0x5c6':
			return "vyxZy";
			break;
		case '0x5ca':
			return "wcluU";
			break;
		case '0x5d0':
			return "tOyvN";
			break;
		default:
			throw new RangeError( e );
			break;
	}
}

(function() {}[xhs__0x4f79('0x1e3')](_0x2764ed[xhs__0x4f79('0x5c6')](_0x2764ed[xhs__0x4f79('0x5ca')], _0x2764ed['\x74\x76\x42\x47\x4f']))['\x63\x61\x6c\x6c'](_0x2764ed[xhs__0x4f79('0x5d0')]));

(function() {}["constructor"]("debugger")["call"]("action"));
```
